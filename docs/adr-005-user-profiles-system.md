## Context and Problem Statement

### Background

The expenses management application currently uses Supabase Auth for user authentication, which provides basic user information (id, email, auth metadata). However, for a complete user experience, we need extended user profile information including display names, profile pictures, and user preferences. The application also needs to seamlessly load user profile data whenever authentication state is checked.

Current state:

- Basic Supabase Auth with email/password authentication
- Minimal user data available (only auth.users table data)
- No centralized user profile management
- Limited user personalization capabilities
- Shared transactions feature requires user display names and avatars

### Problem Description

Users need comprehensive profile management capabilities while maintaining seamless integration with the existing authentication system. Key requirements include:

- **Extended User Data:** Store additional user information beyond authentication
- **Profile Pictures:** Support for user avatars to improve UX
- **Display Names:** Human-readable names for user identification
- **Preferences:** User-specific settings and notification preferences
- **Seamless Loading:** Automatic profile data loading with authentication checks
- **Shared Transactions Integration:** Profile data needed for user selection and display

### Technical Context

- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 15+, React 19+, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS
- **Architecture:** Client-server with RLS-secured database, component-based UI
- **Dependencies:** Supabase Auth, Supabase Storage (for avatars), React Hook Form, Zod validation
- **Performance Requirements:** Profile loading < 500ms, image uploads < 3s
- **Security Requirements:** RLS policies, data privacy, secure file storage

---

## Decision Drivers

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] **FR-1:** Users can view and edit their profile information
- [ ] **FR-2:** Support for profile picture upload and management
- [ ] **FR-3:** Display names for improved user experience
- [ ] **FR-4:** User preferences and notification settings
- [ ] **FR-5:** Automatic profile data loading with authentication
- [ ] **FR-6:** Profile data integration with shared transactions
- [ ] **FR-7:** Profile creation automation for new users
- [ ] **FR-8:** Profile search functionality for sharing features
- [ ] **FR-9:** Export/import profile data capabilities

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] **NFR-1:** Performance - Profile data loading < 500ms
- [ ] **NFR-2:** Security - Profile data protected by RLS policies
- [ ] **NFR-3:** Storage - Support images up to 5MB with optimization
- [ ] **NFR-4:** Scalability - Support for thousands of user profiles
- [ ] **NFR-5:** Accessibility - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for profile forms
- [ ] **NFR-6:** Mobile - Optimized profile management on mobile devices

### Technical Constraints

- [ ] Must integrate seamlessly with existing Supabase Auth
- [ ] Must maintain backward compatibility with current user data
- [ ] Must work with existing RLS policies and security model
- [ ] Must support real-time updates for shared transaction features
- [ ] Must follow established code patterns and architecture

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Enhanced Profiles Table with Supabase Storage (Recommended)

**Description:** Extend the existing `profiles` table with additional fields and integrate Supabase Storage for avatar management, with automatic profile loading in authentication flows.

**Pros:**

- ✅ Seamless integration with existing authentication
- ✅ Leverages Supabase Storage for secure file handling
- ✅ RLS policies already in place
- ✅ Real-time updates with Supabase subscriptions
- ✅ Built-in image optimization and CDN
- ✅ Consistent with existing architecture

**Cons:**

- ❌ Vendor lock-in to Supabase ecosystem
- ❌ Storage costs for profile images
- ❌ Limited image processing capabilities

**Implementation Effort:** Medium
**Risk Level:** Low

### Option 2: External Image Service Integration

**Description:** Use external services like Cloudinary or AWS S3 for image storage while keeping profile data in Supabase.

**Pros:**

- ✅ Advanced image processing capabilities
- ✅ Better performance and CDN distribution
- ✅ More storage options and pricing flexibility

**Cons:**

- ❌ Additional complexity and dependencies
- ❌ Multiple service integrations to manage
- ❌ Higher implementation complexity
- ❌ Additional security considerations

**Implementation Effort:** High
**Risk Level:** Medium

### Option 3: Local File Storage

**Description:** Store profile images locally on the server filesystem.

**Pros:**

- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Complete control over storage
- ✅ Lower costs

**Cons:**

- ❌ Poor scalability
- ❌ No CDN benefits
- ❌ Backup and redundancy challenges
- ❌ Server storage limitations

**Implementation Effort:** Medium
**Risk Level:** High

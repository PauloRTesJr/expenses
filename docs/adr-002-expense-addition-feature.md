## Context and Problem Statement

### Background

The expenses management application currently has a basic foundation with user authentication, database structure, and initial UI components. Users need a comprehensive and intuitive way to add their expenses (and income) to track their financial activities effectively.

The current state includes:

- Supabase database with transactions, categories, budgets, and profiles tables
- Basic transaction form component with installment support
- Authentication system with RLS policies
- Next.js 15+ with React 19+ frontend architecture

### Problem Description

Users need to efficiently record their financial transactions with the following capabilities:

- Add both expenses and income transactions
- Categorize transactions for better organization
- Support for installment payments (parceling)
- Real-time validation and user feedback
- Mobile-responsive interface for on-the-go usage
- Seamless integration with existing budget tracking

### Technical Context

- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 15+, React 19+, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS
- **Architecture:** Client-server with RLS-secured database, component-based UI
- **Dependencies:** Supabase client, React Hook Form, Zod validation
- **Performance Requirements:** Form submission < 1s, page load < 2s
- **Security Requirements:** RLS policies, input validation, XSS protection

## Decision Drivers

### Functional Requirements

- [x] **FR-1:** Users can add expense transactions with description, amount, date, and category
- [x] **FR-2:** Users can add income transactions with the same data structure
- [x] **FR-3:** Support for installment transactions with automatic creation of future entries
- [x] **FR-4:** Real-time form validation with user-friendly error messages
- [x] **FR-5:** Category selection filtered by transaction type (income/expense)
- [x] **FR-6:** Optional categorization (transactions can be uncategorized)
- [x] **FR-7:** Date selection with default to current date
- [x] **FR-8:** Amount input with Brazilian Real currency formatting

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] **NFR-4:** Scalability - Efficient database queries, proper indexing
- [x] **NFR-5:** Accessibility - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigation
- [x] **NFR-6:** UX - Intuitive interface, clear visual feedback, mobile-first design

### Technical Constraints

- [x] Must work with existing Supabase database schema
- [x] Must be compatible with current auth flow and RLS policies
- [x] Must follow existing code patterns and component structure
- [x] Must be responsive and work on mobile devices
- [x] Must integrate with existing category and budget systems

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Modal-Based Transaction Form (Current Implementation)

**Description:** Centralized modal form accessible from multiple pages, supporting both income and expense creation with installment functionality.

**Pros:**

- ✅ Consistent user experience across different pages
- ✅ Overlay design doesn't disrupt current page context
- ✅ Reusable component reduces code duplication
- ✅ Good for quick transaction entry
- ✅ Already partially implemented

**Cons:**

- ❌ Limited screen real estate on mobile
- ❌ Modal management complexity in parent components
- ❌ Potential accessibility concerns with focus management

**Implementation Effort:** Low (building on existing)
**Risk Level:** Low

### Option 2: Dedicated Transaction Creation Page

**Description:** Full-page form with expanded layout and additional features like receipt upload, multiple transaction entry.

**Pros:**

- ✅ More space for advanced features
- ✅ Better mobile experience with full screen
- ✅ Easier to implement complex validation
- ✅ Natural place for bulk operations

**Cons:**

- ❌ Navigation overhead for quick entries
- ❌ Breaks the current flow for dashboard-based entry
- ❌ Requires additional routing and page management
- ❌ More development effort

**Implementation Effort:** Medium
**Risk Level:** Medium

### Option 3: Inline Quick-Add Component

**Description:** Compact form component embedded directly in dashboard and list views for immediate transaction creation.

**Pros:**

- ✅ Fastest user interaction for common use cases
- ✅ No modal or navigation overhead
- ✅ Great for mobile touch interfaces
- ✅ Contextual to current view

**Cons:**

- ❌ Limited space for complex features like installments
- ❌ Potential UI cluttering
- ❌ Harder to implement comprehensive validation
- ❌ May not accommodate all transaction types

**Implementation Effort:** Medium
**Risk Level:** Medium

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Option

**Selected:** Option 1 - Modal-Based Transaction Form (Enhanced)

### Rationale

- Builds upon existing working implementation
- Provides consistent UX across the application
- Balances functionality with development speed
- Allows for focused user interaction without context switching
- Can be enhanced incrementally with advanced features
- Maintains clean component architecture

### Trade-offs Accepted

└── database.ts ✅ (Existing)
```

### Key Components

- **Main Form:** `components/forms/transaction-form.tsx` - Enhanced modal form
- **Service Layer:** `lib/transactions/service.ts` - Transaction CRUD operations
- **Validation:** `lib/transactions/validation.ts` - Zod schemas and validation logic
- **Utilities:** `lib/transactions/utils.ts` - Currency formatting, date handling
- **Types:** Already defined in `types/database.ts`

### Database Changes

The existing database schema already supports the required functionality:

```sql
-- No changes needed, existing schema supports:
-- ✅ transactions table with all required fields
-- ✅ installment support (is_installment, installment_count, installment_group_id)
-- ✅ categories table with type filtering
-- ✅ RLS policies for user data isolation
-- ✅ Proper indexes for performance
```

### API Changes

No new API endpoints needed - using existing Supabase client operations:

- **Transaction Creation:** `supabase.from('transactions').insert()`
- **Category Fetching:** `supabase.from('categories').select()`
- **Installment Logic:** Service layer handles multiple inserts for installments

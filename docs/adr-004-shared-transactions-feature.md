## Context and Problem Statement

### Background

The expenses management application currently supports individual transaction management where each transaction belongs exclusively to its creator. However, in real-world scenarios, financial transactions are often shared between multiple users - such as couples, roommates, families, or business partners who split costs.

Current state:

- Each transaction belongs to a single user (owner)
- No mechanism to share transaction costs with other users
- Budget tracking and financial reports are limited to individual users
- Installment transactions create multiple entries for the same user

### Problem Description

Users need the ability to share transaction costs with other users in the system while maintaining clear ownership and accountability. Key scenarios include:

- **Couple Dining:** One person pays the restaurant bill but the cost should be split between both partners
- **Shared Utilities:** One roommate pays the electricity bill that should be divided among all residents
- **Business Expenses:** Team leader pays for a team lunch that should be attributed to all team members
- **Family Expenses:** Parent pays for children's activities that should be tracked for each child
- **Installment Sharing:** When installments are created, each installment should maintain the same sharing configuration

### Technical Context

- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 15+, React 19+, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS
- **Architecture:** Client-server with RLS-secured database, component-based UI
- **Dependencies:** Supabase client, React Hook Form, Zod validation
- **Performance Requirements:** Transaction creation < 2s, dashboard load < 3s
- **Security Requirements:** RLS policies, user permission validation, data privacy

---

## Decision Drivers

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] **FR-1:** Transaction owner can share costs with other system users
- [ ] **FR-2:** Support multiple sharing methods (equal split, percentage-based, fixed amounts)
- [ ] **FR-3:** Shared users can view transactions shared with them (read-only)
- [ ] **FR-4:** Installment transactions maintain sharing configuration across all installments
- [ ] **FR-5:** Dashboard and reports reflect both owned and shared transactions
- [ ] **FR-6:** Owner retains full control over shared transactions (edit/delete)
- [ ] **FR-7:** Notification system for users when transactions are shared with them
- [ ] **FR-8:** Ability to accept/decline shared transaction participation
- [ ] **FR-9:** Settlement tracking for shared expenses

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] **NFR-1:** Performance - Dashboard with shared transactions loads < 3s
- [ ] **NFR-2:** Security - Users can only see transactions they own or are shared with
- [ ] **NFR-3:** Privacy - Shared users see only necessary transaction details
- [ ] **NFR-4:** Scalability - Support for transactions shared with up to 10 users
- [ ] **NFR-5:** Accessibility - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all new components
- [ ] **NFR-6:** Data Integrity - Consistent sharing state across all installments

### Technical Constraints

- [ ] Must maintain backward compatibility with existing transactions
- [ ] Must work with existing Supabase RLS policies
- [ ] Must integrate with current installment system
- [ ] Must preserve existing dashboard performance
- [ ] Must follow established authentication patterns

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Junction Table with User References (Recommended)

**Description:** Create a `transaction_shares` junction table to manage many-to-many relationships between transactions and users, with additional metadata for sharing configuration.

**Pros:**

- ✅ Normalized database design
- ✅ Flexible sharing configurations (equal, percentage, fixed)
- ✅ Easy to query shared transactions
- ✅ Supports complex sharing scenarios
- ✅ Maintains data integrity
- ✅ Can track acceptance/decline status

**Cons:**

- ❌ Additional database complexity
- ❌ More complex queries for transaction lists
- ❌ Requires migration for existing data

**Implementation Effort:** High
**Risk Level:** Medium

### Option 2: JSON Array in Transactions Table

**Description:** Add a `shared_with` JSONB column to the transactions table containing user IDs and sharing configuration.

**Pros:**

- ✅ Simple database structure
- ✅ No additional tables needed
- ✅ Fast queries for individual transactions
- ✅ Easy to implement

**Cons:**

- ❌ Difficult to query by shared user
- ❌ Limited flexibility for complex sharing
- ❌ Harder to maintain data integrity
- ❌ PostgreSQL JSONB querying complexity
- ❌ Difficult to implement proper RLS policies

**Implementation Effort:** Medium
**Risk Level:** High

### Option 3: Duplicate Transactions Approach

**Description:** Create separate transaction records for each shared user with references to the original transaction.

**Pros:**

- ✅ Simple querying (each user has their own records)
- ✅ Easy integration with existing code
- ✅ Clear data ownership

**Cons:**

- ❌ Data duplication and inconsistency risks
- ❌ Complex synchronization when editing
- ❌ Storage inefficiency
- ❌ Difficult to maintain transaction integrity
- ❌ Problems with installment synchronization

**Implementation Effort:** Medium
**Risk Level:** High

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Option

**Selected:** Option 1 - Junction Table with User References

### Rationale

- Provides the most flexible and scalable solution
- Maintains proper database normalization
- Supports complex sharing scenarios and future enhancements
- Enables proper RLS policies for security
- Allows for detailed tracking and analytics
- Best long-term architectural choice despite initial complexity

### Trade-offs Accepted

- Higher initial implementation complexity
- More complex database queries
- Need for data migration strategy
- Additional testing requirements for junction table scenarios

### Database Schema Changes

```sql
-- New table for managing transaction shares
CREATE TABLE transaction_shares (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  transaction_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES transactions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  shared_with_user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  share_type VARCHAR NOT NULL CHECK (share_type IN ('equal', 'percentage', 'fixed_amount')),
  share_value DECIMAL(10,4), -- Percentage (0.25 = 25%) or fixed amount
  status VARCHAR NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'accepted', 'declined')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- Ensure unique sharing per transaction per user
  UNIQUE(transaction_id, shared_with_user_id)
);

-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_transaction_shares_transaction_id ON transaction_shares(transaction_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transaction_shares_user_id ON transaction_shares(shared_with_user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transaction_shares_status ON transaction_shares(status);

-- Add trigger for updated_at
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER update_transaction_shares_updated_at 
  BEFORE UPDATE ON transaction_shares 
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

-- RLS Policies for transaction_shares
ALTER TABLE transaction_shares ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users can see shares for transactions they own
CREATE POLICY "Users can see shares for their transactions" ON transaction_shares
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM transactions 
      WHERE transactions.id = transaction_shares.transaction_id 
      AND transactions.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Users can see shares where they are the shared user
CREATE POLICY "Users can see shares assigned to them" ON transaction_shares
  FOR SELECT USING (shared_with_user_id = auth.uid());

-- Only transaction owners can insert/update/delete shares
CREATE POLICY "Only transaction owners can manage shares" ON transaction_shares
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM transactions 
      WHERE transactions.id = transaction_shares.transaction_id 
      AND transactions.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Shared users can update their acceptance status
CREATE POLICY "Shared users can update their status" ON transaction_shares
  FOR UPDATE USING (shared_with_user_id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (shared_with_user_id = auth.uid());

-- Add notification preferences to profiles
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS 
  notification_shared_transactions BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
```
